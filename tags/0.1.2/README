To make an installation type:
  # ./configure
  # make
  # make install

Before you can run it you'll need to copy the spindown.conf file to /etc/
and adept it to your needs. You can run the deamon like this:
  # /etc/init.d/spindown start

You can also get the status as following:
  # /etc/init.d/spindown status

To compile the program of debugging purposes compile like so:
  # ./configure debug
  # make

The only difference between debug and normal is that the spindown init script
is generated in sutch a way that it makes spindownd look for all it's files in
the current directory.
