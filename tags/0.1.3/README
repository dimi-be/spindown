To make an installation type:
  # ./configure
  # make
  # make install

Before you can run it you'll need to copy the spindown.conf.example file to
/etc/spindown.conf and adept it to your needs. You can run the deamon like this:
  # /etc/init.d/spindown start

You can also get the status as following:
  # /etc/init.d/spindown status

If you would like to work on the code you can run the daemon from the source
directory. It will then look for all the files there:
  # DEBUG=1 ./spindown start
